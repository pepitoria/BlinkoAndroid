# Blinko Android App

## This project aims to build a functional android client for the blinko project. https://github.com/blinko-space/blinko

This apps was born out of **my** need to add quick notes from my phone to my blinko instance. Right now, the app is in a **very early stage** and only supports the following features:
- Login/Logout (done through the blinko url and session token (which you can find in your settings in your blinko instance))
- List notes
- List blinkos
- Edit notes/blinko
- Adding new notes
- "Share with" functionality with allows you to share (for instance) a url with blinko and create a new note with it.

Right now the app is ugly as hell :), but I am no designer. I am just a guy who wanted to have a quick way to add notes to his blinko instance. Help is welcome though :)

## Installation:
Right now, the app is not available on the play store. You have 3 ways of getting the app:
 - Recommended: Install it using [Obtanium](https://github.com/ImranR98/Obtainium). Obtanium will let you add this repository as a source and will let you update the app easily when there are new releases.
 - Download and install the latest APK from the releases page.
 - Build it yourself using Android Studio.

## Disclaimer:
This app is not affiliated with the blinko project. It is a personal project. Use at your own risk.

## TODO/Roadmap:
- List notes
  - filter by search term
  - filter by tags
- Edit note
  - transform blinko to note
  - transform note to blinko
  - list available tags to be used
