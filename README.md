This project aims to build a functional android client for the blinko project. https://github.com/blinko-space/blinko

This apps was born out of **my** need to add quick notes from my phone to my blinko instance. Right now, the app is in a **very early stage** and only supports the following features:
- Login/Logout (done through the blinko url and session token (which you can find in your settings in your blinko instance))
- List notes
- List blinkos
- Edit notes/blinko
- "Share with" functionality with allows you to share (for instance) a url with blinko and create a new note with it.

TODO/Roadmap:
- List notes
  - filter by search term
  - filter by tags
- Edit note
  - transform blinko to note
  - transform note to blinko
  - list available tags to be used
- Create note
  - create note from the app
